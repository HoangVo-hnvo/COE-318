# COE-318
This repository is for the work that I've done in COE-318 (Software Systems) F2020 which introduces us to the software development cycle

COE-318 is a Ryerson University course that is mandatory for Computer Engineering Students during our 3rd Semester; I've taken this course during F2020. I would also like to recuse myself of any academic misconduct as the intention of this repository is to show my work, so please do not directly copy and paste. 

The majority of the assignments were done individually and were done with the NetBeans IDE program.
